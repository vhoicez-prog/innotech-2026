# Decepta (working title)

Short tagline: Protect infrastructure by hiding real assets behind believable, adaptive decoys and turning attacker actions into high-confidence detection signals.

## Vision
Decepta makes it expensive and time-consuming for attackers to find and attack real assets. Rather than only hardening systems, Decepta actively misleads attackers with high-fidelity decoys, canary tokens, and adaptive attack surfaces — giving defenders early, low-noise signals and safe observation windows.

## Quick start
This repository will hold the orchestrator, decoy templates, sandbox runtime, telemetry pipeline, and a management console. See CONTRIBUTING.md for how to set up a local dev environment.

## Structure
- /go — Go orchestrator scaffold and PoC
- /rust — Rust runtime scaffold
- /deploy — docker-compose for local development
- /docs — design and runbooks
